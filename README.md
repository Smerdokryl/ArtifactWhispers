# ArtifactWhispers
Hello! This AddOn plays sound files randomly according to your [Artifact Weapon](http://battle.net/wow/en/game/artifacts/). In this AddOn, I aim to keep as many lore-friendly, and yet fitting sound files to the artifact weapons. For each and every one, I read and studied how they were created and who wielded them in the past. Maybe some of the weapons had a little piece of the soul of their previous owner or smith, or perhaps the souls of the consumed attempt to speak to you.
## Weapons So Far
There are quite a good amount of weapons this addon features (or will feature as of writing this document.)
These weapons include:

**Death Knight**
* Maw of the Damned
* Blades of the Fallen Prince + Jokes
* Apocalypse

**Demon Hunter**
* Twinblades of the Deceiver

**Druid**
* Claws of Ursoc

**Hunter**
* Titanstrike

**Mage**
- (Aluneth is already in the default game.)
* Felomelorn + Jokes

**Monk**
* Mistweaver (Soon™)
* Windwalker

**Paladin**
* Retribution
  - Corrupted and Non-Corrupted Ashbringer Variants

**Priest**
* Holy (Soon™)
- (Xal'Atath is already in the default game.)

**Rogue**
* Outlaw (Soon™)

**Professions**
* Underlight Angler

## Commands
There are several commands that can be used.
* **/artifactwhispers** or **/aw** will begin all of your commands.
  * **percent**
    - This allows you to adjust the proc change, a value between **0** and up to **100**. The default is **1%** (and **.5%** for Frost Death Knights.)
  * **whispers** **on** or **off**
    - This allows you to enable or disable whispers. You follow this by typing **on** or **off** afterwards. The default is On.
  * **reset**
    - This will reset your settings, in the case that you may encounter an error. It will bring it back to the default states listed above.
  * **info**
    - This retrieves information about your current settings and gives you the commands above.
  * **joke** (Soon™)
    - This plays a joke soundfile, retrieved from the Heroes of the Storm. So far, only Frost DK and Fire Mage have this feature, as there are limited sounds.
  
## Upcoming Features
There are more features I would eventually like to add in, such as implementing older and current Legendaries with similar sounds, situational sound files and a better profile system / menu. I **can't** however work on other language versions, because I don't know any. If you would like to contribute a full new localised version for other clients, please contact me! Creating and obtaining the custom sound files from other clients will be difficult for me.
